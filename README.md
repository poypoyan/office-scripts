Some (MS Excel) Office Scripts I created

### "Installing" a Script
In Excel,
1) Go to Automate menu > New Script. No Automate menu means you cannot use Office Scripts in general.
2) Copy-paste the .ts to code text area and enter script name (e.g., "Paste to Visible Cells") just above the text area. Then save script.

NOTE: Ctrl+Z does NOT work for Office Scripts, so be careful with running! If with Version History enabled, you can undo via restore.
